\frametitle{Setting Up Latex-Math}

All you need to do is to clone the \texttt{latex-math} repository into
\texttt{./latex\_pres}:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone http://www.github.com/compstat-lmu/latex-math
\end{verbatim}

\alert{Note:} If you do not have cloned the repo the code should also compile.
Anyway, you then are not able to use \texttt{latex-math}, obviously.
